# User-Friendly To-Do List with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Create a dynamic To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will allow users to add and remove tasks, validate input, and provide feedback on user actions.

## Requirements

### Features

#### Add Task Functionality:
- Allow users to add tasks to the To-Do List.
- Limit the number of tasks to a maximum of 20.
- If the limit is reached, the "Add Task" button should be disabled.

#### Remove Task Functionality:
- Provide a button to remove the last task added to the list.
- The "Remove Task" button should be disabled if no tasks are present.

#### Input Validation:
- Validate that the input field is not empty before allowing a task to be added.
- Provide user feedback if the input is invalid (e.g., display a message if the task is empty).

#### Dynamic Feedback:
- Display success messages when tasks are added or removed.
- Use a clear error message to indicate issues (e.g., when trying to add an empty task).

#### Real-Time Validation:
- Implement input validation that checks the task input on each keypress and provides immediate feedback to the user.
